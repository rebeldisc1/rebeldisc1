## About Me
Hey there! I'm Rebeldisc, a passionate developer with a keen interest in software development and jailbreaking. I love exploring different programming languages and pushing the boundaries of what's possible with code. Currently, my favorite programming languages are SwiftUI, C, C#, and VB.net. I enjoy working on projects that challenge me and allow me to learn and grow as a developer.

## Current Projects: Noah's Ark
I'm currently working on an semi-untethered jailbreak called Noah's Ark. This jailbreak offers an alternative to the Dopamine Jailbreak.
